OBJECTIVE
The objective of the project is to develop a system that automates the processes and activities of a travel and tourism agency.
 The purpose is to design a system using which one can perform all operations related to travel bookings.

EXISTING SYSTEM
 In the present system a customer has to approach various packages and to find details of places and to book tickets.
 This often requires a lot of time and effort.
 It is tedious for a customer to plan a particular journey and have it executed properly

PROPOSED SYSTEM
 The proposed system is a web based application and maintains a centralized repository of all related information.
 The system allows one to easily access the relevant information and make necessary travel arrangements.
 Users can decide about places they want to visit and make bookings online for travel.
